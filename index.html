            <p>   I attended high school in the small town of Hackleburg, Alabama. It was there that I took a business tech
                essentials class that led to my love for html and, eventually, coding.
                There have been many detours along the way but I am finally working in the Information Technology field
                and futher pursuing my dream of becoming a developer.
            <br>
            <br>
            I currrently work as a Desktop and Software Support Analyst for Sun Life Family Health center. There, my
                team and I provide IT support to fourteen medical centers. From imaging new
                systems to troubleshooting hardware and software issues, our four man team provides the majority of the
                IT support needed at the center.
           <br>
           <br>
            I am currently looking to further my career in IT by attending the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp.
                Using the skills I am leraning, I will be transitioning into a job as a
                developer by the end of 2020.
